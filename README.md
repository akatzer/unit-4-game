Infinity Collector

There are six infinity stones displayed and each has a random but hidden number assigned to it. 

When the user clicks on a stone, Iron Man's score goes up by the random number assigned to it.

Thanos is assigned a random number at the beginning of every game that the user can see.

The goal of the game is to get Iron Man's score to match Thanos'.

If the user is able to match the two scores, the game will alert that Iron Man has saved the universe, add a win to the wins/losses board, and restart the game.

If Iron Man's number exceeds Thanos' the game will alert that Thanos won, add a loss to the wins/losses board, and restart the game.

When the game restarts the number assigned to Thanos will be changed to another randomly selected one. The same will happen to the Infinity stones.
